# Advent of Code 2023 
This is my real first shot at Python. 

# Day 1
First time into python was quite a bit of a challenge.
From my POV kind of weird syntax, but definitely more user-friendly than for example Java. Going to keep going with Python and maybe switch to Go

The first task was pretty easy. Just some simple ASCII and stuff

The second task was one of the hardest things I've ever tried. I got the right answer for the example input on their website, but not for my input

The error was that some numbers that directly began with a number weren't processed correctly, and therefore my variable ```currentMax``` wasn't set correctly. 

For example, ```5hdakjshdkjahsd``` was 50 instead of 55, which resulted in calculation errors.
